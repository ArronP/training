##How To View The Slideshow

Just open the HTML files provided using a modern browser.

The slides make use of a tool called remark.js to display in a browser, and as a result to view the slides in all their glory you'll need a webserver to properly serve them.

The tool is cross platform because it's browser based and still uses markdown mostly compatible with deckset.



##How to contribute

Just do it :)

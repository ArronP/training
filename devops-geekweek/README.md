##How To View The Slideshow

### Option 1

The slides make use of a tool called remark.js to display in a browser, and as a result to view the slides in all their glory you'll need a webserver to properly serve them.  On any machine with python, this is easy:

`python3 -m http.server` from the root directory will give you what you need by accessing `http://localhost:8000`.  Python 2 users may need to use `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000`

### Option 2

Another option is to use a SaaS like services for this like:

<http://remarkjs.com/remarkise>

Just copy the link to the .md you want to display.

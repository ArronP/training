#Container vs Images
A container is a running application. 

You create a container using an image. So think of an image like a recipe.

You create containers from images and you create images from containers.

#What are the benefits of Containers?

* Solve the "Works On My Machine" problem -> Eliminate environment inconsistencies

* Make installation VERY simple

* Allow for delete and upgrade/Easier rollbacks if needed <- NO OS Maintenance

* Share applications in an easier and faster way

* Open / Secure / Lightweight

#Lab Docker Advanced

Welcome to your Docker Advanced Lab :)

In this session you'll be less guided so please free to use and abuse Google searching capabilities ;)


This is what we would like you to achieve:
* Get sample app from git
* write dockerfile
* compile image
* build swarm cluster
* push 2 containers to cluster
* edit app (html?)
* compile
* redeploy your App again

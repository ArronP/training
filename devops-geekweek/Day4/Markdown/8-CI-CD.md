#Microservices

Properties of a Microservice
* Small code base
* Easy to scale, deploy and throw away
* Autonomous
* Resilient

Benefits of a Microservices Architecture
* A highly resilient, scalable and resource efficient application
* Enables smaller development teams
* Teams free to use the right languages and tools for the job
* Rapid application development

#Microservices Needs

Microservices are great, but they require:
* rapid provisioning
* solid monitoring
* rapid deployment
* devops culture

---

# Continuous Integration

* The practice of merging development work with a Master/Trunk/Mainline branch constantly so to test changes
* Promote the code testing as often as possible to catch issues early
* Most of the work is done by automated tests via a unit test framework
* Typically there is a build server performing these tests, so developers can continue working while tests are being performed

---

#Continuous Delivery
* The continual delivery of code to an environment once the developer feels the code is ready to ship
* Be it either UAT, Staging or Production environments
* The idea is to be constantly deliverying code to a user base, whether it be QA or customers for continual review and inspection
* Merges Continuous Integration with automated deployment, test and release
* Doesnâ€™t mean every change is deployed to production ASAP but ready to be deployed at any time

---

#Phases of Continuous Delivery (too much?)

* Unit Test
* Code Quality Analysis
* Deploy to Test Environment 
* Integration Test 
* Packaging and Archiving 
* Deploy to Preproduction Environment 
* Acceptance Test
* Deploy to Production Environment
